# Task 1: Initialize and populate array with on-screen user input.
# Create a script which:
# 1. Asks the user to enter 6 cities, one at a time, and store them into an array called: city_name
# 1a. City names only. Do not include province/state, country, etc. May be helpful to include that in the user instuctions on screen (optional)
# 1b. Some cities use more than one word. Your script should be able to handle this *without* it creating two different array items.
# 1b Example: "New York" is one array item, not two.
# 1c. Very helpful to let the user know what number they're curretly on. Example: "Please enter city name 5: "

# Task 2: Display array elements.
# Create a script which:
# 2. Displays the array elements from *city_name* in reverse order on screen.
# 2a. In your output iteration, be clear to note which array item number is being used, along with the actual value. This should start with array item 6 and say so.
# 2a Example: "Array Item 6: New York" (or, alternatively, "The 6th city you entered was: New York")
