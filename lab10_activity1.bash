# Task 1: Static calculations
# Create a script which:
# 1. Asks the user to enter 6 cities, one at a time, and store them into an array called: city_name
# 1a. City names only. Do not include province/state, country, etc. May be helpful to include that in the user instuctions on screen (optional)
# 1b. Some cities use more than one word. Your script should be able to handle this *without* it creating two different array items.
# 1b Example: "New York" is one array item, not two.
# 1c. Very helpful to let the user know what number they're curretly on. Example: "Please enter city name 5: "
#
# 2. Display array elements in reverse order in the output after all city names have been entered by the user.
